 For the integration of the API, it is used json-server, to create the server based on the local json files.
 Regarding the frontend, it consists two major two views:
 - Home
-  Absences

There are two routes for the frontend:
- "/" => Homepage
- "/absences" => Absences
- (Any other input in URL will redirect to 404 custom component not mentioned in the Routes component in App.js)

# ðŸš€ First step (backend):

- [ ] Change Directory to the api folder
- [ ] npm install -g json-server (Would probably run without running this command)
- [ ] Run command "json-server --watch json_files/index.js -p 4500"

# ðŸš€ Second step (frontend):

- [ ] npm  install


Navigate to "/absences" and will be displayed the list, and you can make the filtration.
